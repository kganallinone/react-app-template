# React Template Documentation

## Overview

This React template is a modern, pre-configured project setup that leverages powerful technologies to streamline your development process. The template is designed with scalability, performance, and ease of use in mind.

## Key Features

- **Pre-configured with Tailwind CSS**: Simplify your styling with utility-first CSS.
- **TypeScript Support**: Enjoy type safety and robust development.
- **Built with Vite**: Experience fast build times and optimized HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **React JS Framework**: Harness the power of React for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Free Utilities Included**: Access pre-built utilities for common development tasks.

## Technologies Used

1. **React JS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. **TypeScript**: A strongly-typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
4. **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tooling for blazing-fast development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this template, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (latest version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` folder.

|-- layouts/          # Layout components to structure pages (e.g., headers, footers)
|-- main.tsx          # Entry point of the application
```

## Utilities Included

This template comes with pre-built utilities to simplify development:

1. **API Helper Functions**: Predefined methods for making API requests.
2. **Custom Hooks**: Hooks for common patterns like fetching data or form handling.
3. **Reusable Components**: Components like buttons, modals, and loaders.

## Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind CSS is fully integrated into the template. You can extend the default configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Example Usage**:

```tsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded">Hello, Tailwind!</div>
```

## TypeScript Support

The template uses TypeScript to enhance your coding experience with type checking and IntelliSense.

**Example**:

```tsx
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

const WelcomeMessage: React.FC<{ user: User }> = ({ user }) => {
  return <div>Welcome, {user.name}!</div>;
};
```
